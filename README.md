# Matrix_multiplication

This program takes in two matrices or a matrix and a vector from the user and prints the matrix product.  The program asks the user for the dimensions and then takes input and processes the data as rows (as opposed to rows and columns) as this seems to be more user-friendly in terms of entering the initial matrices.

Initial release - still requires exception handling and possible format improvements
