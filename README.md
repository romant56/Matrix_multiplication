# Matrix_multiplication

A program I made without imports some time ago while taking a linear algebra course.  Numpy's dot or matmul is probably the tiniest bit more efficient.

This program takes in two matrices (or vectors or scalars) from the user and prints the matrix product.  The program asks the user for the dimensions and then takes input and processes the data as rows (as opposed to rows and columns) as this seems to be more user-friendly in terms of entering the initial matrices.
